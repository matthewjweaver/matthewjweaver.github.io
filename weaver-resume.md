# One-minute précis
I am an accomplished, domain-independent troubleshooter who enjoys solving problems. I also help groups of people work together to solve problems.

I have worked with all components of computing and communication. This includes the wires, protocols, systems, applications, and users. It also extends to the organizations responsible for implementing and operating products and systems.

I've helped build & operate systems comprised of tens, hundreds, and millions of components. I've worked in organizations of anywhere from two people to hundreds of thousands of people.

I've built patchwork, solar-powered wireless networks providing broadband access to remote mountain communities. I've been responsible for the 99.99% availability of Google web search. I helped rescue healthcare.gov.

I specialize in infrastructure and end-to-end problem solving. I enjoy serving as valued counsel and guide to leaders. I can rapidly absorb and distill complexity. I can explain complicated ideas and problems in simple terms. I inspire confidence in people. I remain comfortable and focused in situations of maximum ambiguity, chaos, and pressure.

# Experience
## 2015/10 - *present* : Rogue Leader (and DJ), United States Digital Service
- USDS is a new organization in the Executive Office of the President, bringing world class technical talent into government to work directly on engineering to improve the usefulness, experience, and reliability of government services.
    - > *The idea, hatched by [Federal CTO] Smith’s predecessor Todd Park (who still works as advisor to the president from Silicon Valley) is to replicate the success of the Healthcare.gov rescue and bring the best engineering and design talent from Silicon Valley and elsewhere into the government.* -- Steven Levy, Medium
- I advise USDS leadership (Administrator Mikey Dickerson, Deputy Administrator Haley Van Dyck).
- I built and run USDS's rapid response team.
    - We help restore critical services at various government agencies after catastrophic incidents.
    - We help, directly on behalf of senior leadership, in various high-stakes/high-ambiguity situations when critical services are at risk.

- Built the first in-agency USDS team, inside one of the largest bureaucracies in the country.
    - > *Even among D.C.’s new technorati, people view Weaver as someone separate from the fray. [...] Maybe it’s because he was the one guy who, if he didn’t answer an emergency call, the whole search engine might go down. Or maybe it’s because in a group of brilliant engineers, Weaver, as one of his new colleagues puts it, stands out as "someone who is, like, superhero-fucking-brilliant."* -- Jon Gertner, Fast Company
